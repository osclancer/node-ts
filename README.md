# Node - Express - Typescript `starter kit`

### First
You need to clone the repository by running this command:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/osclancer/node-ts [project name]
```
> replace [project name] with yours

you need to copy the example config and fill it with your configurations:

```
$ cp config/example.ts config/default.ts
```

now you can run the program using `dev` script:
```
$ npm run dev
```

### For test
you can use `test` special script as well.
```
$ npm test
```
